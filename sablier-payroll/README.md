# Sablier Payroll — User-Story Tests (Phase 1)

Phase 1 validates **Sablier Merkle Instant** payroll user journeys on **Hardhat in-memory** (single chain). Phase 2 (later) ports the same stories to PoD.

## Run tests

```bash
bash scripts/sync-sablier-contracts.sh   # copy contracts into hardhat sources
npm run test:sablier-payroll
```

## Success gate

All user stories **S01–S31** pass (35 tests) against `SablierMerkleInstantHarness`:

- Leaf: `keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(index, recipient, amount))))`
- `claim` / `claimTo` sync ERC20 payout
- `hasClaimed(index)`, campaign time bounds, clawback grace
